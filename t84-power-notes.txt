both tests

led blinking w/ 8 second period (4 sec on, 4 sec off)
using watchdog timer to time the intervals

led has 4.7k resistor attached

------------------------

sketch: wdt_blink_lowpwr
processor only running on startup and during transition

also, turned off everything available in Power Reduction Reg (PRR)

in between changes: sleep mode power down (not sleep mode idle)
350 uA when led off
1040 uA when led on

unknown draw when processor wakes up (order of single-digit milliseconds??)

-----------------------

sketch: wdt_blink_test
in between changes: processor left active
1.5 mA when led off
2.5 mA when led on

have visible seen spikes of 2 mA when led first changes to off
have seen visible spikes of 2.9 mA when led first changes to on
unknown what the true maximum spike is (too fast to see)
