internal 8 MHz for CLK(IO)
(not sure if this runs in any of the low power modes)

no prescaling (256 = 1/32 milli second)

64 prescaling (256 = 2 milli seconds)
256 prescaling (256 = 8 milli seconds)
1024 prescaling (256 = 32 milli seconds)

w/ no prescaling at 8MHz,
will take 8000 ticks to get to 1 milli second

w/ 1024 prescaling
will take about 8 ticks to get to 1 milli second
