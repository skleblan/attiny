for I/O regs in attiny84, need to add 0x20 to address
for some reason, the regs are addressed differently
depending on which instructions you use
i think we will always be using ST and LD (store and
load), so we will add 0x20

avr-gcc -mmcu=avr25 blinky01.c

objcopy -O ihex a.out blinky.hex
avrdude -p t84 -c usbtiny

avrdude -p t84 -c usbtiny -U flash:w:blinky.hex:i
